## **Methodology**
This project follows a systematic approach to classify [user profiles by category]. Key steps include:

### **Data Preprocessing**
   - **POST DATA:**
     1. **Timestamp is turned into Hour - Month Day - Week Day**

     2. **Hours/Like Count interaction**

     3. **Correlation of extended(^2, ^3, log) features**

    4. Check for outliers in the like count

    5.Outliers removed by using Interquartile Range Adjustment

   - **PROFILE DATA:**
     1. Unnecessary columns such as url columns, contact information and name columns are dropped
        
     2. Columns with single unique value are dropped
      <img width="933" alt="Ekran Resmi 2025-01-12 19 21 53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ff60222-ddf6-4be3-afb0-3d73800e6090" />

     3.  Numerical and Boolean Columns are turned from object datatype into int and float datatypes
        
     4. Categorical features are transformed using mapping and one-hot encoding.
        
     <img width="716" alt="Ekran Resmi 2025-01-12 19 16 23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6714463e-d300-4395-863c-216cb9c15df8" />

     5. Extracted text features from user biographies and captions using TF-IDF.
        
     6. Scaled the dataset using MaxMin Scaler.
    
        




2. **Model Development**
   - Used **XGBoost** as the primary classification algorithm due to its robustness with tabular data.
   - Hyperparameter tuning via **GridSearchCV** to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Measured precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy for all categories.
   - Addressed class imbalance by carefully monitoring macro and weighted metrics.

4. **Solutions Offered**
   - Improved minority class predictions by using SMOTE and weighting in the model.
   - Provided a comprehensive analysis of feature importance to understand the modelâ€™s decisions.
